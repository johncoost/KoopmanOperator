# KoopmanOperator
Koopman Operator Theory is an approach for the data-driven study of dynamical
systems in terms of measurement functions g(x).
In 1931, Koopman showed that it is possible to represent a non-linear dynamical
system in terms of a linear but infinite-dimensional operator acting on a Hilbert
space of state measurements. This is the so-called Koopman Operator.
