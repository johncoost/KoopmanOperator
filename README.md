# KoopmanOperator
Koopman Operator Theory is a data-driven approach for the study of dynamical
systems in terms of measurement functions g(x).
In 1931, Koopman showed that it is possible to represent a non-linear dynamical
system in terms of a linear but infinite-dimensional operator acting on a Hilbert
space of state measurements. This is the so-called Koopman Operator. 
We introduce the main basic mathematical concepts needed to understand Koopman theory, 
as well as some results which confirm the universal approximation capabilities and 
algorithms that perform this approximation.
